## Iced Coffee - Cold Brew

### Ingredients

* Good dark coffee beans
* Clean water
* Patience

### Why?
While getting a good cup of iced coffee is getting easier these days, it is
still pretty common to be handed a cup of hot coffee poured over ice. Not cool.
Cold brewing the coffee over a long period of time allows for a very strong coffee
concentrate without the harsh bitternees that hot water can often pull out of
your darker roasts.

If you aren't familiar with your local speciality coffee stores, and you are serious
about a good iced coffee, then take the time to get to know them.

### How!
Start with a dark roasted bean. If you like to drink it hot, then it is a good
place to start. Whole beans are a must, or a vendor that is willing to grind them
for you.

Grind the beans as coarsely as your grinder will allow. A coarser grind will also
help with the bitterness.

For every 1.5 ounces of grounds, add 1 cup of warm or cold water. Mix thoroughly.
Refrigerate for at least 12 hours. 24 - 28 is even nicer.

After 24 hours, strain out the grounds however you see fit. I use a mesh kitchen strainer
with an unbleached coffee filter. The filter is optional if you don't mind some grounds.

Store in the refrigerator. Serve over ice, adding water to taste.

I tend to do this in large batches -- 13.5 ounces of coffee with 9 cups of water,
and store it in the fridge. In the morning, I combine 1 cup of the goodness with
3 cups of water and ice, for a 32oz cup of awesome.
